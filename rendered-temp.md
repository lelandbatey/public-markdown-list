# space game

## backstory

i have a friend who is a very smart physicist; he's engineered many really cool devices and tools (like a radiation detector, plasma speaker, and floating speaker, among others). his lifelong dream is to make space travel as accessible as commercial air travel.

this game will be about his journey, but totally not in the conventional sense. the story will simply be a *very* loose metaphor for him succeeding.

this guy's dream is to buy an island in the near future and eventually build a rocket testing facility on it (launch pads, wind tunnels, fuel generation chambers, etc). i want this game to take place on this island.

however, (being inspired by antichamber a little), this game will feature space/time bending puzzles.

## story

### introduction

the introduction will make the game seem like a very standard first person puzzle game. very standard. the player will start somewhere near the launch site, the story up to that point being they are either an engineer doing last minute checks on the rocket, or they're an astronaut about to go to space.

the player, over an intercom (or headset, though maybe an intercom is better, so the player needs to be near a speaker to head "the voice"), is instructed to do some simple tasks in the form of simple puzzles.

after a quick intro to some basic actions (more introduced later), the player is instructed to check something in the rocket (or prepare for lift-off if an astronaut).

the player makes his or her way to the launch pad.

then the rocket.

then into the rocket.

then up a ladder inside the rocket to the cockpit...

### something's not quite right

but when the player gets to the top of the ladder they find not a cockpit, but a room. the player (automatically) fully climbs up this ladder and is able to look around. if the player looks down, he or she finds that the ladder hatch is missing.

from now, space and time bending puzzle will be used, though not immediately. at this point, the player obviously knows that something is wrong, but still manageable. i want the first space bending puzzle to be something as subtle as a series of rooms that couldn't physically be oriented in the real world (like a corridor that keeps turning right into new rooms).

the voice the player heard in the beginning of the game can be heard now instructing the player to go do things (both parties are trying to figure out what happened), but in this space/time bent world, the more space and time is abnormal, the more weird the voice sounds (distorted, modulated, different voice, many voices, some kind of change that's just plain weird, violin solo for no reason, etc).

also, the voice can only be heard when an intercom is nearby. this is so that there are sections of the game the player has to figure out themselves (like the facility part of the portal series).

### more?

here (haven't thought this far), the player and the voice will slowly figure out what has happened (i don't even know yet).

### resolution

of course the game needs to be resolved, and the overall metaphor has to be that my friend i mentioned at the very beginning finally succeeds in creating widely accessible space travel.

the ending could be a ladder that actually take the player to the rocket cockpitâ€¦?
